// the algorithm is :

/* 
1. get the submit button through a document query
2. get all the buttons with a document query all
3. create an empty variable to store the value of the button the user clicks
4. have an event listener to each button and if its clicked the value is stored in the empty variable
5. we then want an event listener on the submit button on if theres a value we want to redirect to the success page with the users rating
included in the success message and if not we want an error message saying to pick a rating first.
